# Adaptive π — Final Drop v1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-10-04

This release consolidates the *Adaptive Critical Symmetry Law* (ACSL) derived from ζₐ(s) zero studies under the Adaptive π framework. It includes baseline, two‑regime, and three‑regime kernels; zero‑locus scans; manifold fits; correction surfaces; and robustness checks.

## 🔑 Headline Results
- **Adaptive Critical Symmetry Law (ACSL):**
  \[ f(α, μ) := \langle σ(t) - \tfrac12 \rangle \;\approx\; k_1 α - k_2 μ + \gamma\,α μ \]
  with empirical ranges:
  - **k₁ ≈ 1.04 ± 0.02**, **k₂ ≈ 0.50 ± 0.02**
  - **γ** depends on mid/far regimes and transition scales; **γ ≈ 0.14** typical with **peaks ≈ 0.16** in three‑regime sweeps.
- **Spectral Universality:** Nearest‑neighbor spacing of zero ordinates remains **GUE‑like** across sweeps (**KS p > 0.05**).
- **Robustness:** Coefficients stable under detection/rounding noise and parameter jitter (Δ < 0.02 for k₁,k₂; γ peak unchanged).

> Interpretation: π → πₐ preserves the ζ‑class spectral symmetry while shifting the critical manifold by a linear term in (α, μ) plus a first cross‑term correction.

## 🧪 What’s Included
- **Code:** ζₐ(s) prototypes; two‑ and three‑regime πₐ kernels; scan & fitting scripts.
- **Figures:** Heatmaps, zero‑trace overlays, manifold surfaces/contours, γ‑contours, GUE KS plots, robustness distributions.
- **Data:** Zero CSVs for all grid sweeps (up to α,μ ≤ 0.1) including two‑ and three‑regime runs.
- **Report:** A concise Results section (Markdown) ready to paste into the whitepaper.

## ⚠️ Scope & Caveats
- ζₐ(s) here is a **numerical prototype** for exploratory analysis; not the final analytic object.
- This is **not a proof** of RH or AπH; it’s quantitative evidence for the adaptive symmetry law.
- Open theory tasks: analytic continuation, adaptive functional equation, explicit formula.
