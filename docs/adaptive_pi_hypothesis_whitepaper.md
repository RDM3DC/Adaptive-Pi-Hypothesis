# Adaptive π Hypothesis — Whitepaper (Draft)

**Author:** Ryan McKenna (@RDM3DC)

## Abstract
We propose an adaptive generalization of π, denoted πₐ, and an associated adaptive zeta function ζₐ(s). The central conjecture (AπH) is an analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis under the substitution π → πₐ, predicting that nontrivial zeros lie on an adaptive critical manifold.

## 1. Definitions
- πₐ(n; α, μ, k₀) = π·(1 + κ(n)), with κ(n) governed by reinforcement α and decay μ (prototype given in code; replace with ARP kernel).
- ζₐ(s) (numeric prototype): ζₐ(s) = ∑ n^{-s·πₐ(n)} for exploratory scans only.

## 2. Conjecture (AπH)
All non-trivial zeros of ζₐ(s) lie on Re(s) = ½ + f(α, μ), with f → 0 as πₐ → π.

## 3. Numerical Program
- Heatmaps of log|ζₐ(s)| over (σ, t).
- Zero-locus tracing vs adaptive manifold.
- Pair correlation / spacing vs GUE as α, μ vary.

## 4. Open Problems
- Analytic continuation of ζₐ.
- Adaptive functional equation.
- Explicit formula linking primes↔zeros under πₐ.
